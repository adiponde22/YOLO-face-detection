**YOLO Face Detection with OpenCV**
This repository contains a Python script for real-time face detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model implemented with OpenCV. YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that can detect and locate objects in real-time, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including face detection. This project provides a simple implementation of YOLO for detecting faces in a webcam feed.

**Features:**
- Real-time face detection using a pre-trained YOLO model.
- Draws bounding boxes and labels around detected faces.
- Adjustable confidence threshold and non-maximum suppression parameters.

**Usage:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the YOLO weights file (`yolov3-wider_16000.weights`) and the YOLO configuration file (`yolov3-face.cfg`).
3. Create a text file named `face.names` with class names (e.g., "face" in this case) for labeling the detected objects.
4. Ensure you have OpenCV installed (`pip install opencv-python`).
5. Run the `yolo_face_detection.py` script to start real-time face detection using your webcam.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

# YOLO Face Detection with OpenCV

This Python script uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model implemented with OpenCV for real-time face detection in a webcam feed.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using a pre-trained YOLO model.
- Draws bounding boxes and labels around detected faces.
- Adjustable confidence threshold and non-maximum suppression parameters.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- YOLO weights file (`yolov3-wider_16000.weights`)
- YOLO configuration file (`yolov3-face.cfg`)
- Class names file (`face.names`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Download the YOLO weights file (`yolov3-wider_16000.weights`) and the YOLO configuration file (`yolov3-face.cfg`).

3. Create a text file named `face.names` with the class names (e.g., "face" in this case) for labeling the detected objects.

4. Run the `yolo_face_detection.py` script to start real-time face detection using your webcam.

```bash
python yolo_face_detection.py
```
