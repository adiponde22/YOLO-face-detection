# YOLO Face Detection with OpenCV

This Python script uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model implemented with OpenCV for real-time face detection in a webcam feed.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using a pre-trained YOLO model.
- Draws bounding boxes and labels around detected faces.
- Adjustable confidence threshold and non-maximum suppression parameters.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- YOLO weights file (`yolov3-wider_16000.weights`)
- YOLO configuration file (`yolov3-face.cfg`)
- Class names file (`face.names`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Download the YOLO weights file (`yolov3-wider_16000.weights`) and the YOLO configuration file (`yolov3-face.cfg`).

3. Create a text file named `face.names` with the class names (e.g., "face" in this case) for labeling the detected objects.

4. Run the `yolo_face_detection.py` script to start real-time face detection using your webcam.

```bash
python yolo_face_detection.py
```
